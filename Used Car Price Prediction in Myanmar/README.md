# Used Car Price Prediction
### Note: The dataset presented in the portfolio was modified to preserve the data privacy and confidentiality of the client.

## Objectives

- To develop a predictive model for estimating second-hand car prices in Myanmar's market.
- Address the gap in car-selling platforms by providing a data-driven price recommendation system.

## Impacts

- Successfully delivered a model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of USD 2,222 and an R-squared (RÂ²) value of 0.85.
- Contributed to the decision-making process of sellers and buyers by offering a transparent and data-informed pricing mechanism, potentially leading to a more balanced and fair marketplace.

## Challenges and Further Improvements

- Faced difficulty in sourcing quality data due to the lack of public records on second-hand car sales prices.
- Encountered issues with low sample size and model bias towards certain car models.
- Potential model enhancements through advanced feature engineering and dimensionality reduction techniques for better accuracy and generalisability.
