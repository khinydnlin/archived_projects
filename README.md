# Khin Yadanar Lin's Portfolio 

## Background

Hello and welcome to my portfolio.

I have over eight years of experience in **Business Strategy, Market Research, and Analytics** with a focus on consumer behaviours and market analysis. My educational background includes a Bachelor’s in Business Management and a Master’s in Business Analytics. After years of delving into data collection and statistical analysis of survey data, I've come to recognise the immense power of data in driving business value. This realisation propelled me to explore beyond conventional analysis, seeking out more sophisticated tools and techniques. Now, as I transition into a data science career, I'm actively looking for job opportunities where I can apply these advanced data tools to tackle real-world business issues.

This portfolio showcases a diverse collection of personal and freelance projects undertaken as part of online courses, various data challenges from platforms like Maven Analytics and Kaggle, and independent contracts. The projects are organised into three distinct categories: Data Analytics, Data Visualisations, and Data Science. In these projects, I predominantly employ MySQL, R, Python, and Power BI to demonstrate versatility and depth in my analytical approach. I am also open to learning new tools and I am constantly working to improve my tech stack.
