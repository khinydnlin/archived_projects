# Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository, where I showcase a curated collection of my work in data analytics, visualization, and data science. Here, you'll find a diverse range of projects that demonstrate my hands-on experience with extracting insights from data, building predictive models, and designing compelling data visualizations.

This repository serves as a testament to my journey in the field of data science and my continuous effort to push the boundaries of data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to explore each project, review the code, and reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
